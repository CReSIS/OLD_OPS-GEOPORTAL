	<h2> What is the OpenPolarServer?</h2>
	<p> OpenPolarServer is a complete spatial data infrastructure (SDI) designed and implemented at The Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets at the University of Kansas. The SDI stores CReSIS L2 data in a spatial database and uses WebGIS technologies to serve the data through a web interface known as a geoportal. This service is intended to be the primary data distribution source for CReSIS, although the <a href="https://data.cresis.ku.edu/"> FTP site</a> will continue to operate as normal.</p>
	<h2> What can I do with the OpenPolarServer?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Download any CReSIS data you would like in a variety of formats! </li>
		<li> View radioechograms by clicking on a flightline in a map! </li>
		<li> View flightlines over various reference datasets (velocity,bedrock,imagery,etc...) </li>
		<li> Much more! </li>
	</ul>
	<h2> Where can I get the source code? </h2>
	<p> OpenPolarServer is a free and open source project. That means you are free to develop on the source code and use it for whatever you need to! Take a look <a href="https://github.com/kpurdon/OPS" target="_blank"> on GitHub.</a> </p>
